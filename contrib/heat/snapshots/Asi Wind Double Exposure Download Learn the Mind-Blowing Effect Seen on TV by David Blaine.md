## What is Double Exposure?
 
Double Exposure is a card trick that was created by Asi Wind, a world-renowned magician and mentalist from Israel. He has performed this effect for celebrities like David Blaine, Penn & Teller, and Jimmy Fallon, and has received rave reviews from magicians and laypeople alike.
 
The effect is simple but stunning. The magician asks a spectator to name any card, and then shows that the deck is shuffled and mixed. He then asks the spectator to hold the deck face down and cut it anywhere they want. The magician takes out his phone and snaps a picture of the spectator holding the deck, with the top card visible.
 
The magician then asks the spectator to turn over the top card and show it to everyone. It is not the named card. The magician acts surprised and confused, and then asks the spectator to look at the picture on his phone. To everyone's astonishment, the card in the picture has changed to the named card!
 
This is a miracle that happens in the spectator's hands and leaves them with an impossible souvenir. The best part is that there are no gimmicks, no switches, no sleight of hand, and no forces involved. It is a pure and elegant effect that relies on psychology, timing, and misdirection.
