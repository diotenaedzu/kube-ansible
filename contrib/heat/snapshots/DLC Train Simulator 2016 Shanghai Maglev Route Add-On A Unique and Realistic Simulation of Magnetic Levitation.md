The Vision Development module is a software package that enables users to capture, process and analyze images from various sources. It consists of three main components: Vision Acquisition Software, Vision image processing library and Vision Assistant image prototyping software. Vision Acquisition Software is a driver that supports image acquisition cards and standard buses, such as USB, Ethernet and Camera Link. It allows users to configure and control their cameras and devices. Vision image processing library is a collection of functions and algorithms for image manipulation, enhancement, measurement and inspection. It provides users with tools for tasks such as edge detection, pattern matching, OCR and barcode reading. Vision Assistant image prototyping software is a graphical interface that helps users to design and test image processing applications. It offers users a way to create and modify scripts, generate code and debug their applications.
